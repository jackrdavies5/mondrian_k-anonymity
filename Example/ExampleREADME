Example
----------------------------------------------------

example.csv shows some psuedo-data with four attributes: Sex/Education/Occupation/Income
In this example, Income is the sensitive attribute.

example_out.csv shows a strict 2-anonymisation (k=2) of example.csv where the Sex/Education/Occupation attributes were used as QIDs.

This was executed with command:
